# This is a distance calculator designed to provide relevant information for a journey from one city to another. When provided with the names of two cities as input, such as Delhi and Mumbai, it can calculate the distance between them and provide additional data such as the train and flight status, and time duration.

# This project utilizes Selenium Webdriver, a powerful automated testing tool, to fetch data from the backend of a travel website. The data is extracted from the popular mapping service, Google Maps, and used to provide users with relevant information about their travel options.

# In addition to providing users with valuable travel information, this project also includes a contact us feature, allowing users to easily get in touch with the project's creator for support or feedback.


# Overall, this project showcases the power of automation and data extraction, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to plan a trip between two cities and obtain essential information about travel options. It also demonstrates the importance of effective web development, with clear and concise templates and easy-to-use features for users.
